What is friendship all about?,<br />
My Little Pony, My Little Pony,<br />
Friendship is magic!,<br />
(My Little Pony),<br />
I used to wonder what friendship could be.,<br />
(My Little Pony),<br />
Until you all shared its magic with me.,<br />
When I was young I was too busy to make any friends.,<br />
Such silliness did not seem worth the effort it expends.,<br />
But my little ponies, you opened up my eyes,<br />
And now the truth is crystal clear, as splendid summer skies.,<br />
And it's such a wonderful surprise.,<br />
(My Little Pony),<br />
I used to wonder what friendship could be.,<br />
(My Little Pony),<br />
Until you all shared its magic with me.,<br />
When danger makes me want to hide, you'll Rainbow Dash to my side,,<br />
Kindness is never in short supply, once smitten twice Fluttershy.,<br />
For honesty no pony can deny, you are the Applejack of my eye,,<br />
A heart that shines so beautiful, a Rarity to come by,<br />
And you all make fun and laughter as easy as Pinkie Pie!,<br />
(My Little Pony),<br />
I used to wonder what friendship could be.,<br />
(My Little Pony),<br />
Until you all shared its magic with me.,<br />
Our friendship's magic and it's growing all the time.,<br />
A new adventure waits for us each day is yours and mine.,<br />
We'll make it special every time!,<br />
We'll make it special every time!,<br />
(My Little Pony),<br />
What a wonderful wonder friendship brings,<br />
(My Little Pony),<br />
Do you know you're all my very best,<br />
(Friends!) Friends, you're my very best,<br />
(Friends!) Friends, you're my very best,<br />
(Friends!) Friends, you're my very best,<br />
(Friends!) Friends!,<br />
